#### Some History

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1997 when I was 10. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Fighter II, and Galaga. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- We subscribed to AOL in 1999. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.

- At 14, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.

- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires 3.
